Tip: Start with air drag only (quadratic), then layer other effects one by one; this keeps the code modular and easy to debug. 7 \u00b7 Conclusions Maximum range on level ground occurs at \u2248 45 \u00b0 when drag and launch height are negligible. Range scales as \\(v_0^2 / g\\) , so higher launch speeds and lower gravity (e.g., Moon) dramatically increase distance. Non-zero launch/landing height skews the curve : optimal angle drops if you start high and rises if you must clear a cliff. Real-world design choices rarely use the textbook 45 \u00b0 because of drag, safety clearances, and target elevation. Numerical tools bridge the gap between ideal equations and messy reality , letting engineers tune launch angle, speed, and spin for specific goals. 8 \u00b7 Further Reading J. B. Marion & S. T.
